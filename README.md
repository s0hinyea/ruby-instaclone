I am preparing for a Software Engineering Internship interview with **Betterment**, and part of the interview includes **two Ruby on Rails (RoR) paired programming sessions**.

The interview is focused on collaboration and problem-solving within a **Rails web application**, not algorithm-heavy problems. I’ll likely be asked to:
- Add or modify small features in a Rails app (e.g. likes, follows, comments)
- Implement routes, controllers, and ActiveRecord models
- Write or fix simple tests (RSpec)
- Communicate my reasoning clearly while coding

To prepare, I’m following the YouTube tutorial **“Learn Ruby on Rails - Full Course (CREATE INSTAGRAM)”**, which walks through building an **Instagram clone app** in Rails.  
I’m running this project inside **WSL (Ubuntu)** on my local machine using **Cursor** as my IDE.

My current project goals:
- Understand Rails fundamentals (MVC, routes, controllers, models)
- Learn ActiveRecord associations and validations
- Practice creating small features end-to-end (CRUD, likes, comments, follows)
- Get comfortable reading and writing Ruby syntax
- Build interview-style confidence in explaining my code and design

When I ask for help, please:
- Explain Rails and Ruby concepts clearly but concisely
- Show idiomatic Ruby/Rails code
- Reference Rails 7+ or 8 syntax when relevant
- Focus on how features connect through the MVC flow
- Offer debugging help or setup guidance for WSL when needed
- Avoid over-engineering; keep examples clean and interview-relevant

The project folder is my Rails app (an Instagram clone). I might ask you to:
- Generate models, controllers, or routes
- Explain Rails errors
- Write tests
- Suggest improvements for clarity and maintainability
- Simulate “pair programming” discussions like in a Betterment interview
